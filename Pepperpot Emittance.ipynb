    "# Loading the Image Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The image output arrays need to be loaded and this is also a good place to declare some global variables. We'll need the position of a pixel (or row/column of pixels, or other sample of the image, to be determined) in x and y coordinates, the associated pixel intensity, and the pixel moment--that is, how far the pixel is displaced from the center of the corresponding mask hole. The moment may be more easy to break down by finding the difference between the pixel and the unweighted (geometric) beamlet center, and the distance from the hole center to the beamlet center, and adding those two distances together. In the case of missing beamlets, this is also where the correction for that would go...something like, if the distance between a beamlet and the previous beamlet is more than 1.5 times the hole spacing then assign zero for the intermediate hole (and make a loop for 2.5 times the spacing, 3.5, etc., or find the nearest integer number of hole spaces or something like that...figure out later)"
